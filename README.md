Recently I have realized that I need to track my expenses. Unfortunately I could not find existing application that would fit me perfectly: too many configurations, options, buttonsâ€¦ So I decided to create my own app and share it with you. 

Outlay makes tracking your expenses so easy and simple. Fewest taps are necessary to create an expense. Customize your categories with colors, icons, order. Reports with charts give overview of exactly where your money is going each day, week or month.

 - clean user experience and simple interface
 - custom categories with color, icon
 - exhaustive reports per day, week, month

And the best part:

 - no annoying adds 
 - application does not require any permission, 
 - free and open-source

App covers all of my current needs, but there are a lot of possible improvements, so feel free to request features and share your feedback. As its open-source you can tune it as you like.

### Developers
Of course you can find a lot of good practices here, but there are a lot of things that could have been done better. Project is pretty simple now, and I wanted to keep that way.
